# treasure-hunt-game
In this game we had to find the hidden treasure in space.
In this game after subsequent  guesses for X and Y coordinate for finding treasure,the computer compares the player’s previous guess with
their current guess, and if the player’s current guess is further away from the
treasure coordinates than their previous guess was, the computer tells the player
that they are “getting colder.”
If the player’s current guess is closer to the treasure coordinate than their
previous guess was, the computer will tell the player that they are “getting warmer.”
When the player guesses the correct number, the computer tells the player that   
they have won.
